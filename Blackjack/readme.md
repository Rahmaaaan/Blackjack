# Blackjack

This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game where you, the player, face off against the computer acting as the dealer. The game follows standard Blackjack rules with a few specifics:

- The deck is unlimited in size.
- There are no jokers.
- The cards in the deck include [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10].
- Jacks, Queens, and Kings count as 10.
- The Ace can be counted as 11 or 1.
- Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.

## Game Flow

The game operates according to the following flowchart:

## Running the Game

To play the game, simply run the main script. The computer will act as the dealer, and you, the player, will interact to hit or stand based on the cards dealt.

### Instructions:

- Execute the main script (main.py, blackjack.py, etc.).
- Follow the prompts to decide whether to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand).
- The game will compare the player's and dealer's hands to determine the winner.
