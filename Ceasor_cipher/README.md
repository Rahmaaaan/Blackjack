# Ceasor Cipher
 
The Caesar Cipher is a simple and widely known encryption technique. It operates by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. For instance, with a shift of 3, 'A' would become 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Converts plaintext into ciphertext by shifting characters according to a chosen key.
- **Decryption**: Deciphers ciphertext back into plaintext using the same key used for encryption.
- **Customizable Shift**: Users can choose the shift value for encoding and decoding messages.

## Usage

### Installation

To use the Caesar Cipher:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the encryption/decryption script (e.g., `main.py`).

### Instructions

1. Run the script.
2. Choose between encryption or decryption mode.
3. Enter the plaintext or ciphertext, depending on the selected mode.
4. Input the desired shift value.
5. Obtain the resulting ciphertext or plaintext.

### Example

For instance, encrypting the message "HELLO" with a shift of 3 would result in "KHOOR".
