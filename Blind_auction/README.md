# Blind auction

This Blind Auction is a platform designed to conduct auctions where bidders submit their bids without knowing the bids of other participants. It ensures anonymity, encouraging fair bidding and preventing bias based on other bids.

## Features

- **Anonymity**: Bidders submit their bids without knowing the bids of other participants until the auction ends.
- **Secured Bidding**: Ensures confidentiality by keeping all bids hidden until the auction concludes.
- **Winner Selection**: Automatically determines the highest bid as the winner once the auction ends.
- **Time Management**: Allows setting specific durations for bidding periods.

## Usage

### Installation

To use the Blind Auction System:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Run the auction system application.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Start a new auction specifying the item or service being auctioned.
2. **Bidding Phase**: Bidders submit their bids within the designated timeframe.
3. **Anonymity**: All bids remain hidden from other participants throughout the auction duration.
4. **Auction Conclusion**: Once the bidding phase ends, the system reveals the highest bid and declares the winner.
